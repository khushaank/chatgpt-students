ChatGPT for Students - Prompt Showcase
Author: Khushaank Gupta

Project Description
This project is a single-page, fully responsive website designed to showcase 100 useful ChatGPT prompts for college students. The prompts are categorized into "Study," "Career," and "Life." The design is clean, modern, and interactive, inspired by the ChatGPT aesthetic and built to be easily deployable.

Key Features
Dynamic Theme Switching: The color scheme and hero/footer images change based on the selected category (All, Study, Career, Life).

Fully Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly from mobile to desktop screens.

Full-Screen Mobile Menu: An animated, full-screen overlay for navigation on smaller devices, with a circular hamburger button that transforms into a close icon.

Masonry Grid Layout: A dynamic masonry-style layout for the prompt cards that adjusts the number of columns based on screen size, creating a visually appealing "cluttered" look.

Interactive Prompt Cards: Cards feature a subtle zoom effect on hover, and an arrow icon appears to indicate interactivity.

URL Hash Navigation: The active category is reflected in the URL hash (e.g., index.html#study), allowing for direct linking to specific categories.

Modern UI/UX: Built with modern design principles, including smooth animations, modals, and a sticky navigation bar for filters.

Self-Contained: All HTML, CSS (via Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript are contained within a single index.html file for simplicity and portability.

Accessible: Uses rem units for scalable typography and layout.

Setup and Usage
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Download the Code: Save the index.html file to your local machine.

Create Image Directory: In the same directory where you saved index.html, create a folder named images.

Add Assets: Place all the required image assets into the images folder. This includes:

all_1.png, all_2.png, all_3.png

study_1.png, study_2.png, study_3.png

career_1.png, career_2.png, career_3.png

life_1.png, life_2.png, download.png

Open in Browser: Open the index.html file directly in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge). For the best experience, you can use a local server (e.g., VS Code's Live Server extension).
